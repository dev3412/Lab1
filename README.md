Graphs are mathematical structures that are used to represent relationships between objects or entities. They consist of nodes, also known as vertices, and edges that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs are widely used in various fields to model and analyze complex systems. Graphs are powerful tools that help in understanding patterns, trends, distributions, and relationships within the data. Here are some commonly used graphs to analyse the data:

# Histogram
A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data. It consists of bars where the height of each bar represents the frequency or relative frequency of data within a specific range or bin.

# Bar Graph
A bar graph represents categorical data using rectangular bars. The height or length of each bar corresponds to the frequency or proportion of data in each category.

# Line Graph
A line graph displays data points connected by straight lines. It is useful for showing trends over time or comparing different groups or variables.
# Scatter Plot
A scatter plot displays individual data points as dots on a graph. It is used to examine the relationship between two numerical variables. Each dot represents the values of two variables for a single observation, and the pattern of dots reveals the nature of the relationship (positive, negative, or no correlation).

# Box Plot
A box plot (also known as a box-and-whisker plot) summarizes the distribution of numerical data using quartiles. It provides information about the median, range, and presence of outliers.

# Pie Chart
A pie chart represents categorical data as slices of a circle, with each slice representing the proportion or percentage of each category.

# Probability Distribution
Graphs such as the probability density function (PDF) or cumulative distribution function (CDF) are used to represent continuous probability distributions, such as the normal distribution, exponential distribution, or Poisson distribution.
